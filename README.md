## Modules

### Data Collection
This module uses APIs to fetch real-time data for various cryptocurrencies, focusing on the top 18 cryptocurrencies by market cap.

### Data Processing
This module cleans and transforms the raw data into a format suitable for visualization and user interaction.

### Visualization
This module uses Plotly, a Python graphing library, to create interactive, publication-quality graphs. It includes histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and line charts to display current price distribution, market cap, price vs volume, and price changes over time.

### User Interface
This module uses Dash to create an interactive web-based user interface. Users can select a specific cryptocurrency from a dropdown menu to view detailed information and charts.
